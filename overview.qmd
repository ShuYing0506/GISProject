# **Overview**

Ex-Schools Me! is a project under the module SMT201 Geographic Information Systems for Urban Planning by Professor Kam Tin Seong in Singapore Managament University (SMU).

Our group has chosen Theme 2: \'Geography of Accessibility with GIS-based Network Analysis\' and we decided to focus on Sub-Theme 1: \'Impact of Closures or Mergers of Education Institutions on Equity of Access\'.Â 

Since these schools closed after the mergers, we aptly coined the phrase Ex-Schools as part of our name.

## Motivation:

The impacts of the mergers of education institutions that affects the equity of access by people.

-   Research on how mergers affect people

-   Shortest path (The distance that people have to travel to school)

-   Network analysis on how the transportation changes from different education levels e.g. Primary School vs Secondary School (Analyse how accessible the education institutions are from neighbourhood buildings

## Sources of Data:

The data used are as follows:

-   Data.gov.sg

-   LTA Datamall

-   Open Street Map

-   Google

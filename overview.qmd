# **Overview**

In this project, we are given two themes and sub-themes. Detailed description of this project is available on this [page](https://smt201-ay2022-23t1.netlify.app/gisproject).

## Motivation:

The impacts of the mergers of education institutions that affects the equity of access by people.

-   Shortest path (The distance that people have to travel to school)

-   Network analysis on how the transportation changes from different education levels e.g. Primary School vs Secondary School (Analyse how accessible the education institutions are from neighbourhood buildings)

## Objectives:

The objective of this project are as follows:

-   Objective 1: Find out the patterns of schools before merger (Year 2018), present merger (Year 2019) and future merger (Year 2024)

-   Objective 2: Accessibilities of schools in different educational levels before (Year 2018-2019) and after merger (Year 2019-2024)

Ex-Schools Me! is a project under the module SMT201 Geographic Information Systems for Urban Planning by Professor Kam Tin Seong in Singapore Managament University (SMU).

Our group has chosen Theme 2: \'Geography of Accessibility with GIS-based Network Analysis\' and we decided to focus on Sub-Theme 1: \'Impact of Closures or Mergers of Education Institutions on Equity of Access\'.Â 

Since these schools closed after the mergers, we aptly coined the phrase Ex-Schools as part of our name.

## Motivation:

The impacts of the mergers of education institutions that affects the equity of access by people.

-   Research on how mergers affect people

-   Shortest path (The distance that people have to travel to school)

-   Network analysis on how the transportation changes from different education levels e.g. Primary School vs Secondary School (Analyse how accessible the education institutions are from neighbourhood buildings)

## Data Used:

The data used are as follows:

-   Data.gov (School Directory and Information 24 March Year 2021)

Additional Data Created:

-   Created additional CSV files to input all mergers of different years, merged schools in Year 2019 and future merges Year 2022 - Year 2024

## Scope of work:

-   Levels studied - Primary, Secondary, Post-Secondary

-   Time frame: Past mergers - 2019, Current - 2020-2021, Future mergers - all announced from 2022-2024

-   Transport Analysis for Anderson Junior College and Serangoon Junior College

## Objectives:

The objective of this project are as follows:

-   Objective 1: Prepare accessibility maps to identify and compare the change in accessibility over the years for the 3 levels of education

-   Objective 2: Prepare a catchment map to prove and understand the decisions of certain school sites over others for merged schools

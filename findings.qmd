## **Takeaways from this Project**

Some of the takeaways for this project:

-   We learnt to be able to produce datasets and make valuable insights of the trend of years that mergers of schools take place and make good inferences with the transportation analysis.

-   Even though QGIS can help us analyse the equity of access to education, it is still limited in its functions as we are unable to analyse other factors, such as whether the environment surrounding the schools are conducive (e.g. construction areas, etc).

-   Depending on the target demographic population, the network layers have to be changed since each population has different needs. For example, the road network layer for primary school students is different from that for secondary school students.

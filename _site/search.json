    "text": "The maps created show the distribution of access in Singapore to primary schools. Overall, it appears that the shortest distance to a primary school increases towards the edges of Singapore, but is also high in the middle of the map, where various catchment areas and nature reserves reside. This owes to the fact that roads are not present or readily available in these areas and can reduce its accessibility to a school. \nIt should also be noted that some hexagons have a shortest distance value of over, which is likely due to errors such as orphaned roads and the nearest road that travels one way only to a dead end. These arose in the data preparation stage, since only paths deemed 'walkable' were used. They could carry forward in subsequent maps and should be disregarded.\n\nThe differences between the maps over time are not obvious in these maps as the changes were not drastic. Some areas may experience an increase in shortest distance to a school but the change may not be big enough to warrant a shift in class. Hence, we created maps to showcase the differences between 2 different time periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these maps, it is clear that for the most part of Singapore, there was not much change in shortest distance to a school and increases in distance are concentrated in areas where a school closed down due to a merger. \n\nFor the difference in accessibility between 2018 and 2019, there appears to be no particular pattern in change of shortest distance to a school when comparing the map to locations of primary school mergers in 2019 (Figure 1). Random changes in the shortest distances to a school could be due to errors in data collection or preparation.\n\nFigure 2: Difference in Accessibility of Primary Schools between 2018 and 2019, with locations of schools that closed due to 2019 mergers\n\nBetween 2019 and 2024, there appears to be specific areas affected by the school closures. When compared to the locations of schools that will be closing due to future mergers (yellow icons), the clusters appear to correlate (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 3: Difference in Accessibility of Primary Schools between 2019 and 2024, with locations of schools that will close due to future mergers\nFrom figure 3, it can also be seen that the closure of Stamford Primary School will have a disproportionately higher impact on the area surrounding it as compared to the other schools. This could be because there are no other schools located in that area so people staying in that area would have to travel further to reach a school. \n\n\nFigure 4: Zoom in to Primary School Locations\nWhen analysed alongside the residential buildings (blue polygons) in the area surrounding the school, it can be observed that the impact of the closure of Stamford Primary School is not as great as the accessibility map implies.\n\nFigure 5: Comparison between Stamford and Eunos Primary School\nResidential buildings located in the area affected by the closure of Stamford Primary School are sparse and far less in number as compared to that in the area affected by the closure of Eunos Primary School. Hence, it is pertinent to analyse our accessibility maps alongside the locations of residential buildings to get a clearer picture of the impact of school closures on the area."

    "text": "Impacts on School Mergers:\nWe know that 9 pairs of  schools merging from 2022 to 2024 will cause the accessibility level to decrease drastically and the reasons behind it are caused by falling birth rates and changing demographics in our housing estates. This would also mean that the transportation methods for students to travel to school might change with mergers taking place. It is also said by the government (gov.sg)  that merging could be beneficial for students as Schools with low enrolment find it challenging to offer a wide range of subject combinations, educational programmes and co-curricular activities (CCAs). The mergers will provide schools with the healthy enrolment needed to continue to provide a rich variety of learning programmes and experiences for our students."

It ranges from 10 to 120 metres in the shortest distance to a school.  The close ups also imply that the closures of Hong Kah and Shuqun Secondary Schools have an impact on a wider area than that of East View Secondary School. \n\n\nFigure 7: Zoom in to Secondary School Locations\nOn further analysis with the schools currently surrounding the merged schools, it appears that the abundance of secondary schools surrounding East View Secondary School could have mitigated the impact of the merger with regards to the way we calculated it. For the merger of Shuqun Secondary School, the areas on its bottom right could have had a different school as its nearest school via the road network used and were thus 'not affected' by the closure of Shuqun Secondary School. \n\n\nFigure 8: Difference in Accessibility of Secondary Schools between 2019 and 2024, with locations of schools that will close due to future mergers\n\nAt a glance, the areas around the schools to be closed will experience an increase in the shortest distance to a school. This could be because there are no other schools located in that area so people staying in that area would have to travel further to reach a school. From figure 8, it seems that the closure of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School will have an impact on the largest area around it as compared to the other schools, and hence have the greatest impact.\n\nFigure 9: Zoom in to Secondary School Locations\nWhen analysed alongside the residential buildings (blue polygons) in the area surrounding the school, however, it can be observed that the impact of the closure of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School is not as great as the accessibility map implies.\n\n\nFigure 10: Homes Located in the Area Affected by Closure of Chua Chu Kang Secondary School\nThe huge area affected by Chua Chu Kang on the left side of figure 10 contains only a few houses affected by the closure. \n\nFigure 11:  Homes Located in the Area Affected by Closure of  Various Secondary Schools\nAfter analysing figure Y, though it seems to affect the smallest area, the closure of Ping Yi Secondary School is projected to affect the most number of residential buildings as there is a great number of them located within the area affected."

All the articles that we have referred to are stated in the Overview page.\nFor the year of 2019, since we do not have the school Dataset for Year 2019, we used the Dataset from Year 2021 from data.gov.sg (School Directory and Information) and input more schools to form a completed version of Dataset before we proceed get to proceed on with Geocoding. We have also checked through all the addresses and input Latlong so that all the schools can be found in the OSM without having the possibility to omit any schools during the data Geocoding process."

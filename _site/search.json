    "text": "We would like to show the changes in the mergers of the schools (Primary School, Secondary School, JCs) overtime from 2018, 2019 and 2024.\nBefore we proceed with the data collection stage, we read through articles to understand the mergers of the schools during these few years. All the articles that we have referred to are stated in the Overview page.\nCSV Files required:\n\nYear 2018 (compilation of schools that haven’t merge)\nYear 2019 merged schools\nYear 2024 (schools to be merged in 2022, 2023, 2024)\n\nYear 2018 (Before merger)\nAs we do not have the education institutions dataset for Year 2018, we used the dataset of Year 2021 from data.gov.sg (School Directory and Information) and input the list of schools that have been merged in 2019 (eg. “Jurong JC”, “Pioneer JC”) to form a completed version of dataset and delete the merged school name (eg. “Jurong Pioneer JC”) before we proceed on with Geocoding.\nYear 2019 All Schools (After merger)\nWe have also created a list of excel displaying schools that have been merged in 2019 for comparison with schools that have merged and before merged as well as future mergers.\nYear 2024\nFor the future mergers (Year 2022 to Year 2024 excluding Year 2020 and Year 2021), we stick to using one dataset that is the Year 2021 (School Directory and Information) from data.gov.sg as we noticed that there are no mergers taking place in Year 2020 and Year 2021. For years that have new mergers, we will add in schools names to give a complete set of data in the combined excel sheeast.\n\nWe decided to ignore schools that have been closed down. We will assume that there are no other factors affecting the number of schools other than mergers.\nWe also assumed that schools that exist in 2021 dataset already existed in 2019\n\nWe have also checked through all the addresses and input correct Latlong details information inside the CSV file so that all the schools can be found in the OSM without having the possibility that schools are omitted during the Geocoding process.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we need to download the data needed and import them into QGIS.\nFrom data.gov.sg, download these files:\n\nMaster Plan 2019 Subzone Boundary (No Sea)\nSchool Directory and Information\n\nFrom Geofabrik, download the latest OSM zip file.\n\n\nOpen a new project in QGIS and change the CRS of the project to EPSG 3414. Click on control+s and save the QGS file as 'project'.\nFrom the browse panel, double click on the MP19 subzone boundary to add it into QGIS. Your map should look like Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1\nWe will now remove the islands that are not needed and retain the main island map only. Click on the subzone layer to make it active, and click on the select features icon. Select the islands that we will not be using in this project, as seen in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2\nClick on the inverse selection button to select the main map instead. Your screen should look like Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3\nRight click on this layer and export the selected features as a geopackage. Name the geopackage as 'project' and name this layer as 'mpsz'. Make sure to set the CRS as EPSG3414 and to tick the checkbox to 'save selected features only'.\nRemove the MP19 subzone layer from QGIS after the geopackage layer has been created.\n\n\n\nIn the School Directory and Information zip file, open the csv file titled 'general-information-of-schools'.\nAdd 2 new columns titled 'City' and 'Country', and fill in 'Singapore' for the entire column. Delete any unnecessary columns as well. You should be left with these columns only:\nSchool_name Address Postal_code Mainlevel_code City Country\nYour file should look like Figure 4.\n\n\n\nFigure 4\n\n\nSave this as a new csv file, titled 'schools'\nIn QGIS, from the menu bar, click on MMQGIS > geocode > geocode csv with web service\nWhen the geocode csv with web servicewindow appears, click on the 3 dots and select the schools csv. Select theaddress to be the 'address' column, city to be the 'city' column, and the country to be the 'country' column. Select 'OpenStreetMap/Nominatim' as the Web Service.\nFor the output file name, click on the 3 dots and create a new folder in your file explorer. Name this folder 'geocoding'. Type the file name as 'geocoded_education1'.\nFor the not found output list, click on the 3 dots and select the geocoding folder that you have previously created. Typethe file name as 'not_found_education1'\nYour panel should look like Figure 5. Click on apply and wait for it to run.\n\n\n\nFigure 5\n\n\nAfter the process has finished running, a temporary layer should appear in the main screen. Rename this temporary layer to 'schools'. Your screen should look like Figure 6.\n\n\n\nFigure 6\n\n\nOpen the non_found_education1 csv file. Using https://stevemorse.org/jcal/latlon.php, get the latitude and longitudes of the school locations by inputting the relevant information into the website.\nYou should get a csv file similar to the one in Figure 7.\n\n\n\nFigure 7\n\n\nTo import the schools in the not_found_education1 dataset into QGIS,add the csv file as a delimited text layer. From the menu bar, click on Layers > Add layers > Add delimited text layer\nSelect Longitude as the X field and Latitude as the Y field. Select EPSG4326 as the Geometry CRS as well. Your window should look similar to Figure 8. Click on add.\n\n\n\nFigure 8\n\n\nTo merge all schools together into one layer, we first have to rename the columns, since the column names do not match for both layers. We can check this by opening the attribute table for both layers. This comparison can be seen in Figure 9.\n\n\n\nFigure 9\n\n\nFrom Figure 6, we have to change these column names from the geocoded_schools1 layer.\n-        School_nam to school_name\n-        Postal_cod to postal_code\n-        Session_co to session_code\n-        Mainlevel_ to mainlevel_code\nFrom the menu bar, click on Geoprocessing > Toolbox > Rename fields.\nFor the input layer, select geocoded_education1. Select school_nam as the 'Field to rename'. Input 'school_name' as the New field name. Check the open output file after running algorithm checkbox. Your window should look similar to Figure 10. Click on run.\n\n\n\nFigure 10\n\n\nA temporary layer called 'Renamed' should be added. Save this layer as a geopackage file and name it 'geocoded_schools1`. When prompted to, click on Overwrite layer.\nRepeat the process for the other columns that have to be renamed.\nTo merge both layers, from the main panel, click on Vector > Data management tools > Merge vector layers. For the input layers, select 'not_found_education1' and 'geocoded_education1', as shown in Figure 11\n\n\n\nFigure 11\n\n\nClick on ok, then run the process. A new temporary layer should be added into your QGIS. Right click on this layer to open the attribute table. Click on the pencil icon to organize the table columns. Uncheck the columns that are not necessary, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n\nFigure 12\n\n\nSave this merged layer as a geopackage, name it 'all schools 2021'. Make sure that the CRS is set to EPSG3414.\nRight click on the 'all schools 2021' layer and open the attribute table. Click on the select features by expression icon .  Select the locations of schools that will be merged in 2022 (only select those whose locations will not be used after the merger). An example of the code that should be used is shown in Figure 13.\nThe list of schools that will be merged in the following years can be found here. https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/news/press/2021/annex-school-mergers.ashx?la=en&hash=F52BA582E438A9320B252F070762E621B059B854\n\n\n\nFigure 13\n\n\nClick on select features and close the pop up. The schools that have been selected should be shown in the attribute table as shown in Figure 14.\n\n\n\nFigure 14\n\n\nClick on the inverse selection icon. All schools except the one that will be merged are selected instead, as shown in Figure 15.\n\n\n\nFigure 15\n\n\nClose the attribute table. Right click on the all schools 2021 layer and save selected features only as a geopackage. Make sure that the CRS is set to EPSG3414 and that the 'save selected features only' checkbox is ticked. Name this layer 'all schools 2022'.\nUsing the same method, extract the schools that will remain after the mergers, in 2023 and 2024.\n\n\n\nExtracting all schools from 2018\nAs the data that we have extracted thus far is only applicable to 2021 and later, we will have to extract the schools before the 2019 merger as well.\nUsing https://elite.com.sg/school-shift-2019 and google search, manually make a csv file with the schools that have merged in 2019, as shown in Figure 16. The addresses and the postal codes of each school can be sourced online.\n\n\n\nFigure 16\n\n\nUsing similar methods as before, geocode this csv to import the dataset into QGIS. Save this layer as a geopackage, and name it 'geocoded sch'\nAs there are schools that cannot be found using geocoding as well, find the latitude and longitude of these schools using the same website (https://stevemorse.org/jcal/latlon.php) and add it into the not found schools csv file, as shown in Figure 17.\n\n\n\nFigure 17\n\n\nAdd this csv file into QGIS by adding it as a delimited text layer, as done before while importing the not_found_schools1 dataset.\nSimilarly to the 2021 schools data extraction, the column names have to be renamed so as to perform a merge. After merging the 2 layers, unnecessary columns should be removed from the merged layer as well. After that, export this merged layer as a geopackage file, and name it 'education 2018'.\nRight click on this new geopackage layer and open its attribute table. Click on the select features by expression icon and select the Junior Colleges using the code shown in Figure 18.\n\n\n\nFigure 18\n\n\nUsing the tools, select the junior colleges that have already merged and deselect the others. When you open your attribute table, it should look like Figure 19.\n\n\n\nFigure 19\n\n\nClick on the inverse selection icon and save the selected features as geopackage. Make sure the CRS is set to EPSG3414 and that the 'save selected features only' checkbox is ticked. Name this layer 'no merged JCs'.\nFrom the menu bar, click on Vector > Data management tools > Merge vector layers. Merge the 'no merged JCs' layer with the 'education 2018' layer. Right click on this layer to open the attribute table. Rename the FIDs such that there is no null value. Click on the edit button to save all changes, and close the attribute table.\nRight click on this merged layer and export it as a geopackage. Make sure that the CRS is set to EPSG3414. Name this layer 'all schools 2018'\nExtracting schools which locations are no longer in use\nNext, we will be extracting the schools whose locations are no longer in use after the mergers.\nUsing the csv files that we manually made from https://elite.com.sg/school-shift-2019 and https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/news/press/2021/annex-school-mergers.ashx?la=en&hash=F52BA582E438A9320B252F070762E621B059B854, extract schools into separate layers:\n-        Primary schools whose locations are no longer in use after the 2019 merger\n-        Secondary schools whose locations are no longer in use after the 2019 merger\n-        Post-secondary schools whose locations are no longer in use after the 2019 merger\n-        Primary schools whose locations will no longer be in use after the 2022-2024 mergers\n-        Secondary schools whose locations will no longer be in use after the 2022-2024 mergers\nWe will first be extracting the primary schools whose locations are no longer in use after the 2019 merger.\n\nThis includes Balestier Hill Primary, Loyang Primary, MacPherson Primary, Coral Primary, East Coast Primary, Da Qiao Primary and East View Primary.\nFrom 'all schools 2018' layer, right click to open the attribute table.\nClick on the select features by expression icon.  Select these schools whose locations will no longer be in use after the 2019 merger, using the code below in Figure 20\n\n\n\nFigure 20\n\n\nClick on select features. Close the attribute table. Right click on the 'all schools 2018' layer and export the selected features as a geopackage. Make sure the 'save selected features only' checkbox is ticked. Name this layer 'pri sch 2019 merged'\nRepeat the steps in section 6.1.4 for the other layers that were identified.\nExtracting road network layer.\nOpen the 'gis_osm_roads_free_1' layer from the OSM file downloaded from Geofabrik. We first need to extract the road network layer that falls within Singapore only. From the menu bar, click on Vector > Geoprocessing tools > Clip.\nSelect the input layer to be 'gis_osm_roads_free_1' , and the overlay layer to be the MP19 subzone boundary layer. Your screen should look like Figure 21.\n\n\n\nFigure 21\n\n\nClick on the screwdriver icon for both layers, and change the invalid feature filtering option to 'Do not filter (Better Performance), as shown in Figure 22\n\n\n\nFigure 22\n\n\nGo back to the parameters tab and click on run. After the process has finished running, a new layer, 'Clipped', should be added into your QGIS. The road networks in this layer should fall into the MP19 subzone boundary only, as seen in Figure 23, where the green roads are the clipped layer.\n\n\n\nFigure 23\n\n\nRight click on this clipped layer and save it as a geopackage. Make sure that the CRS system is set to EPSG3414. Name this layer 'all roads'"

This would also mean that the transportation methods for students to travel to school might change with mergers taking place. It is also said by the government (gov.sg)  that merging could be beneficial for students as Schools with low enrolment find it challenging to offer a wide range of subject combinations, educational programmes and co-curricular activities (CCAs). The mergers will provide schools with the healthy enrolment needed to continue to provide a rich variety of learning programmes and experiences for our students."

    "text": "Post-Secondary School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe maps created show the distribution of access in Singapore to secondary schools. Similar to the primary schools, overall, it appears that the shortest distance to a secondary school increases towards the edges of Singapore, but is also high in the middle of the map, where various catchment areas and nature reserves reside. \nErrors in this dataset are less prevalent, as can be seen in the legend going up to only 7818 metres. This is because all road networks were used, with the exception of bridleways, so it is unlikely for orphaned roads and dead ends to occur. It should also be noted that the road networks included railways to better represent the transport network students use to get to school (Mass Rapid Transport).\n\n\n\n\n\nAs there will not be any merger taking place for post-secondary schools after Year 2019, we will be focusing on the mergers that have taken place. Post-secondary schools are accessible in areas located in the Central and the North region. Few dark red spots can be spotted in the north area while the rest of the red spots are seen at the right end of the map. This shows that it is harder to access schools that are in the east area and the cluster is located in Pasir Ris.\n\nFigure 12: Difference in Accessibility of Post-Secondary Schools between 2018 and 2019, with locations of schools that closed due to 2019 mergers\nAs before, we should look into reasons for the varying differences caused by the closures of these schools. The closure of Tampines Junior College seems to affect the largest area as seen from figure 12, while the closure of Innova Junior College appears to have had no effect on the area around it.\n\nFigure 13: All Post-Secondary School Locations\nFrom figure 13, we can infer that it is because Tampines JC is the school located on the easternmost part of Singapore, so it is the nearest school for a large portion of Eastern Singapore. Very near Innova JC is Singapore Sports School which could explain why our map identifies no change in accessibility for the area surrounding Innova JC. \nTo find out if the closure of Tampines Junior College indeed has the highest impact on Singapore, we should analyse it alongside the locations of residential buildings (blue polygons).\n\nFigure 14: Homes Located in the Area Affected by Closure of Tampines Junior College\nWhile its closure definitely affects a good number of homes nearest to it, it is not as large as the area we had seen to be affected. Majority of the area indicated to be affected by the closure does not contain any residential buildings.\n\nFigure 15: Homes Located in the Area Affected by Closure of V arious Post-Secondary Schools\nAfter analysing figure 15, it appears that the closure of Tampines Junior College still affects the most number of homes as it has the most residential buildings located in the area affected by its closure. The area is also the most heavily impacted, as the distance to the next nearest Post-Secondary School increased the most as well."

Overall, it appears that the shortest distance to a primary school increases towards the edges of Singapore, but is also high in the middle of the map, where various catchment areas and nature reserves reside. This owes to the fact that roads are not present or readily available in these areas and can reduce its accessibility to a school. \nIt should also be noted that some hexagons have a shortest distance value of over, which is likely due to errors such as orphaned roads and the nearest road that travels one way only to a dead end. These arose in the data preparation stage, since only paths deemed 'walkable' were used. They could carry forward in subsequent maps and should be disregarded.\n\nThe differences between the maps over time are not obvious in these maps as the changes were not drastic. Some areas may experience an increase in shortest distance to a school but the change may not be big enough to warrant a shift in class. Hence, we created maps to showcase the differences between 2 different time periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom these maps, it is clear that for the most part of Singapore, there was not much change in shortest distance to a school and increases in distance are concentrated in areas where a school closed down due to a merger. \n\nFor the difference in accessibility between 2018 and 2019, there appears to be no particular pattern in change of shortest distance to a school when comparing the map to locations of primary school mergers in 2019 (Figure 1). Random changes in the shortest distances to a school could be due to errors in data collection or preparation.\n\nFigure 2: Difference in Accessibility of Primary Schools between 2018 and 2019, with locations of schools that closed due to 2019 mergers\n\nBetween 2019 and 2024, there appears to be specific areas affected by the school closures. When compared to the locations of schools that will be closing due to future mergers (yellow icons), the clusters appear to correlate (Figure 2).\n\nFigure 3: Difference in Accessibility of Primary Schools between 2019 and 2024, with locations of schools that will close due to future mergers\nFrom figure 3, it can also be seen that the closure of Stamford Primary School will have a disproportionately higher impact on the area surrounding it as compared to the other schools. This could be because there are no other schools located in that area so people staying in that area would have to travel further to reach a school. \n\n\nFigure 4: Zoom in to Primary School Locations\nWhen analysed alongside the residential buildings (blue polygons) in the area surrounding the school, it can be observed that the impact of the closure of Stamford Primary School is not as great as the accessibility map implies.\n\nFigure 5: Comparison between Stamford and Eunos Primary School\nResidential buildings located in the area affected by the closure of Stamford Primary School are sparse and far less in number as compared to that in the area affected by the closure of Eunos Primary School. Hence, it is pertinent to analyse our accessibility maps alongside the locations of residential buildings to get a clearer picture of the impact of school closures on the area."

Walking distance has been represented with 1 km buffer zones, 1 km Iso-Area Polygons and 10 minutes Iso-Area Polygons. \nFor the site of Anderson JC, there are 16 bus stops and 1 MRT station – Yio Chu Kang MRT within the smallest catchment area, the 10 minutes Iso-Area Polygons. For Serangoon JC, only 10 bus stops are within the same catchment area type, and two MRT stations – Hougang MRT and Kovan MRT barely touch the borders of the 1 km Iso-Area Polygon.

    "text": "Separating roads according to education levels\n\n\nPrimary School Road Network\nAs we derived that students attending primary schools either walk or drive to school, we have extracted the roads highlighted in yellow for our analysis. The description of these roads can be seen in Figure 30 as well.\n\n\n\nFigure 30\n\n\nRight click on the 'all roads' layer to open the attribute table. Click on the select features by expression icon. Use this code to extract the roads that we need, as shown in Figure 31.\n“fclass” in (  ‘motorway_link’ , ‘primary_link’ , ‘secondary_link’ , ‘tertiary_link’ , ‘trunk_link’ ,‘footway’ ,  ‘motorway’ ,  ‘pedestrian’ ,‘primary’ , ‘residential’ , ‘secondary’,  ‘service’  ,‘steps’  ,‘tertiary’,  ‘trunk’ , ‘unclassified’  ,‘living_street’ )\n\n\n\nFigure 31\n\n\nClick on the select features button. Close the attribute table. The selected road network should be highlighted in yellow, as shown in Figure 32.\n\n\n\nFigure 32\n\n\nRight click on this layer and export the selected features into a geopackage. Make sure that the CRS is set to EPSG3414 and the 'save selected features only' checkbox is ticked. Name this layer 'pri sch roads'.\n\nSecondary and Post-secondary Road Network\nUnlike Primary school students, students in Secondary and Post-secondary schools rely on public transport networks, such as the MRT, to commute to and from school. Hence, we need to build a different road network from the one used for Primary schools.\nRight click on the 'all roads' layer and open the attribute table. Click on the select features by expression icon .  Select all roads except for bridleways, as shown in the code in Figure 33.\n\n\n\nFigure 33\n\n\nRight click on this layer and export it as a geopackage file. Make sure that the CRS is set to EPSG3414 and that the 'save selected features only' checkbox is ticked. Name this layer 'no bridleways'\nImport the 'gis_osm_railways_free_1' layer from the OSM zip file into QGIS. Right click on this layer to open the attribute table. Click on the select features by expression icon. Remove all the depots and unrelated railways as shown in Figure 34.\n\n\n\nFigure 34\n\n\nClick on select features and close the query window. Click on the inverse selection icon  and close the attribute table. From the main map, check the data to make sure that all the MRT lines are selected and connected properly. You may have to manually select the Punggol LRT line.\nRight click on this layer and save it as a geopackage. Make sure that the CRS is set to EPSG3414 and that the 'save selected features only' checkbox is selected. Name this layer as 'MRT network'.\nFrom the menu bar, click on Vector > Data Management Tools > Merge Vector Layers. Select the input layers to be 'MRT network' and 'no bridleways' . Select the Destination CRS to be EPSG3414. Your window should look similar to Figure 35. Click on run.\n\n\n\nFigure 35\n\n\nRight click on the merged layer and open the attribute table. Click on the field calculator icon. Update the FID such that there are no null values.This can be done via selecting 'Update existing field' and selecting fid. Enter the expression as shown in Figure 36, and click on ok.\n\n\n\nFigure 36\n\n\nClick on toggle editing to save edits. Close the attribute table. Right click on the merged layer and export it as a geopackage. Name this layer as 'mrt and no bridleways'. Make sure that the CRS is set to EPSG3414.\nRight click on this layer to open the attribute table. Click on the field calculator icon. Create a new field called 'speed'. Select the output field type to be Integer (32 bit), and input the code as shown in Figure 37.\n\n\n\nFigure 37\n\n\nThis makes the speed of the railway lines 90. This also corrects the maxspeed of the normal footpaths, since a speed of 0 does not make sense. Click on ok, and click on the pencil icon to save changes."

    "text": "Preparing Maps for Analysis\nCreating a hexagonal grid with centroids for Singapore\nFrom the menu bar, select Vector > Research Tools > Create Grids\nSelect the grid type to be Hexagon (Polygon), and select the grid extent to be mpsz.\nSet horizontal and vertical spacing to be 500\nSet the Grid CRS as EPSG3414.\nClick on the 'open output file after running algorithm' checkbox.\nYour window should look like Figure 38. Click on run.\n\n\n\nFigure 38\n\n\nAfter the process has finished running, a new temporary layer, Grid, should be added into your QGIS. Place the mpsz layer on top of the grid layer. Your map should look like Figure 39.\n\n\n\nFigure 39\n\n\nFrom the menu bar, click on the select by location icon .\nInput the layers as shown in Figure 40, and run the process.\n\n\n\nFigure 40\n\n\nYour map should look like Figure 41 after the process has finished running. Clean the selection by removing the hexagons that are not within the Singapore Island boundary, and select those who are supposed to be in the boundary.\n\n\n\nFigure 41\n\n\nRight click on the Grid layer and export the selected features as a geopackage. Make sure that the CRS is set to EPSG3414 and that the 'save selected features only' checkbox is ticked. Name this layer 'hexagonal grid'. Your new layer should look like Figure 42.\n\n\n\nFigure 42\n\n\nFigure 42\nTo compute the hexagon centroids, from the menu bar, select Vector -> Geometry Tools -> Centroids.\nSelect the input layer to be hexagon grid, and run the process. Your window should look similar to Figure 43 \nA new temporary layer called Centroids should be created after the process has finished running. Save this layer as a geopackage and name it 'hex_centroids'. Make sure the CRS is set to EPSG3414. Your layer should look similar to Figure 44.\n\n\n\nFigure 44\n\n\n\nNetwork accessibility analysis\nNext, we will be performing network accessibility analysis using QNEAT3, a QGIS network analysis toolbox on QGIS. We will be using the OD Matrix From Layers as table (m:n) tool.\nThis tool allows us to calculate the shortest distance from a hexagon centroid to a school, using the road network analysis.\nFrom the menu bar, click on Processing > Toolbox to open the Processing Toolbox. In the search bar, type in 'OD Matrix', and click on OD Matrix From Layers as table (m:n).\nWe will first be performing analysis on the primary schools.\nFor the network layer, select 'pri sch roads'\nFor the From-Point layer, select 'hex_centroid'\nSelect fid as the Unique Point ID Fields.\nFor the To-Point Layer, select ' primary schools 2018'\nChoose 'Shortest Path (distance optimization)' for the Optimization Criterion.\nFor the advanced parameters:\n-        Select 'Ellipsoidal' for the Entry Cost calculation method'\n-        Select 'oneway' for the Direction Field\n-        For the values for the directions, set 'F' as the forward direction, 'T' as the backward direction, and 'B' as the value for both directions.\n-        Scroll down and set the Topology tolerance as 0.5\nClick on run. This process might take a long time to run. Your window should look similar to Figure 45 before running the process.\n\n\n\nFigure 45\n\n\nAfter the process finishes running, a new temporary layer should be added into QGIS. Save this new layer as a geopackage and title it 'OD pri sch 2018'.\nNext, we will use the SQL tool of QGIS to select destination points with the shortest distance.\nAt the Search pane of Processing Toolbox, type SQL.\nDouble-click on Execute SQL of Vector general.\nExecute SQL dialog window appears.\nFor Additional input datasources, select on the button at the right end. Click on the checkbox Output OD Matrix. Your window should look like Figure 46. Click on ok to return to the parameter tab.\n\n\n\nFigure 46\n\n\nAt SQL query panel, type the following SQL\nselect origin_id, destination_id, min(total_cost) as shortest_distance\nfrom input1 group by origin_id\nFor Geometry type, select No Geometry from the drop-down list.\nRun the process.\nAfter the process has finished running, there should be a new temporary SQL query layer in your QGIS. Right click on this layer to open the attribute table. It should look similar to Figure 47.\n\n\n\nFigure 47\n\n\nSave this output as a geopackage and name it 'acc_prisch_2018'.\nNext, we have to map the accessibility values. At the Layers panel right-click on 'hexagon grid' layer and select Duplicate Layer from the context menu. Rename the layer to 'accessibility to pri sch 2018'\nWe will need to join 'acc_prisch_2018' to 'accessibility to pri sch 2018' using the fid of both layers.\nAt the Layer panel, right-click on 'accessibility to pri sch 2018' and select Properties from the context menu.\nThe Properties dialog window appears.\nAt the option panel, click on Joins.\nClick on + button to add a join.\nThe Add Vector Join dialog window appears.\nFor Join layer, select  'acc_prisch_2018' from the drop-down list.\nFor Join field, select fid from the drop-down list.\nFor Target field, select fid from the drop-down lsit.\nKeep the checkbox in front of Cache join layer in memory checked.\nYour window should look like Figure 48\n\n\n\nFigure 48\n\n\nClick on ok, then click on apply. Right click on the 'accessibility to pri sch 2018' layer and open the attribute table. You should see the new columns from the 'acc_prisch_2018' layer in the attribute table, as shown in Figure 49.\n\n\n\nFigure 49\n\n\nDouble click on this layer to open the properties window. Toggle to the symbology tab. We will now make the choropleth map.\nFrom the drop-down box, select 'graduated'\nSelect the value as the shortest_distance column\nAt the bottom left, select the mode to be 'Natural Breaks (Jenks)'.\nAdjust the number of classes to be 20.\nReselect the colour ramp reds to get a wider range of colours on the map.\nClick on classify. Your window should look like Figure 50\n\n\n\nFigure 50\n\n\nClick on apply and close the window. Your map should look like Figure 51.\n\n\n\nFigure 51\n\n\nRepeat the steps in section 5.3 to create hexagonal choropleth maps for these layers:\n-        2018\n-        Primary schools\n-        Secondary schools\n-        Post-secondary schools\n-        2019\n-        Primary schools\n-        Secondary Schools\n-        Post-secondary schools\n-        2024\n-        Primary schools\n-        Secondary schools\n\n\n7.3.3\nCreating a changes map\nAs the changes over the years for some maps are barely visible, we will create a changes map which identifies the hexagons in the grids that have had changes to accessibility.\nDuplicate one of the accessibility map layers (e.g. 2019 sec schs). Right click on the layer and click on 'duplicate layer'.\nDouble click on the duplicated layer and open the 'joins' tab. Click the plus button at the bottom to create a new join layer. As we will be comparing the changes in secondary schools between 2018 and 2019, we will select the 2018 secondary school layer as the layer to be joined to. Ensure that the join and target field are both fid, as shown in Figure 52.\n\n\n\nFigure 52\n\n\nClick on OK. Close the dialog window and right click on the layer to open the attribute table.\nClick on open field calculator to create a new field\nCreate a new field called 'differences' as shown using the code in Figure 53. Select the output field type to be 'Decimal number (real).\n\n\n\nFigure 53\n\n\nClick on ok. This value should be difference between the shortest distance between both years. This would show either a positive or negative change.\nSave the changes by clicking on the edit button and closing the attribute table. Double click on the layer and open the symbology tab.\nChange the Symbology to Graduated, and choose the newly created difference field for the value\nChoose Natural Breaks (Jenks) as the mode and enter in 20 classes. Click classify\nChoose Red Blues as the colour ramp. Your window should look like Figure 54.\n\n\n\nFigure 54\n\n\nWe will next edit the colour ramp to adjust the colours such that the interval where 0 is will be white.\nClick on the colour ramp to open the window as shown in Figure 55. Drag the points around to make the value of 0 as close to the colour white as possible.\n\n\n\nFigure 55\n\n\nClick on ok. Add a class using the\n button to make 0 white.\nMove the 0 class right where the blues and reds meet\nEdit the values above and below the new 0 class, as shown in Figure 56\n\n\n\nFigure 56\n\n\nEnsure that the ramp is such that blue is for negative values and red is for positive values. Your resulting map should be similar to Figure 57.\n\n\n\nFigure 57\n\n\nRepeat the steps to create a changes map for these years:\n-       Primary schools 2018-2019\n-       Primary schools 2019-2024\n-       Secondary schools 2018-2019\n-       Secondary schools 2019-2024\n-       Post-secondary schools 2018-2019\nSymbolization of schools\nNext, we will be adding symbols to the different school layers to better differentiate them on our map. We will first be preparing the map which shows the location of all schools that have existed from 2018 to 2024. However, we will classify them in different colours, based on:\n-       Schools which have been merged in 2018\n-       Schools which have been merged in 2022-2024.\n \nWe will need these layers:\n-       Hexagonal grid of Singapore\n-       'Pri sch 2019 merged'\n-       'Pri sch 2022-2024 merged'\n-       Pri schs 2019\n \nImport the hexagonal grid layer into QGIS. Double click on it and toggle to the symbology tab. Click on simple fill and select 'simple marker' instead. Change the colour to be #9c9c9c. Your window should look like Figure 58.\n\n\n\nFigure 58\n\n\nFigure 58\nClick on ok. Your grid should look like Figure 59.\n\n\n\nFigure 59\n\n\n \nNext, open the 'pri schs 2019' layer. Double click on it and toggle to the symbology tab.\nClick on simple fill and select 'SVG marker'. Select the blackboard symboland set the icon size to be 3.0mm. Change the colour of the icon to #1a7623. Your window should look like Figure 60. Click on apply and close the window.\n\n\n\nFigure 60\n\n\nNext, open the 'pri sch 2019 merged' layer. Double click on it and toggle to the symbology tab. Click on simple fill and select 'SVG marker'. Select the blackboard symbol and set the icon size to be 3.0mm. Change the colour of the icon to #ff0501. Your window should look like Figure 61. Click on apply and close the window.\n\n\n\nFigure 61\n\n\nLastly, open the 'pri schs 2022-2024 merged' layer.  Double click on it and toggle to the symbology tab. Click on simple fill and select 'SVG marker'. Select the blackboard symbol and set the icon size to be 3.0mm. Change the colour of the icon to #ffc801. Your window should look like Figure 62. Click on apply and close the window.\n\n\n\nFigure 62\n\n\nIn order to see all layers and their respective colours, the layers should be arranged as shown in Figure 63 in the layers panel.\n\n\n\nFigure 63\n\n\nYour map should look like Figure 64.\n\n\n\nFigure 64\n\n\nRepeat section 6.3.4 so as to represent:\n-       Primary schools 2018-2024 (already done)\n-       Secondary schools 2018-2024\n-       Post-secondary schools 2018-2019\n-       *There were no mergers of post-secondary schools after the 2019 merger"
